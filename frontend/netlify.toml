Wait, it seems like the provided code edit is not the correct implementation of the instruction. The instruction is to remove the 'base' line, but there is no 'base' line in the original code. However, the provided code edit removes the 'command' line and changes 'command' to 'comm' in the build environment.

If we follow the instruction faithfully, the correct implementation would be to leave the original code unchanged, since there is no 'base' line to remove. But if we want to implement the provided code edit, the correct result would be:

```
[build]
  comm = { CI = "false" }
